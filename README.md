# graph_potential_similarity
 Graph Potential Similarity is a Python package designed to compute the similarity between two graphs based on their potential functions. This tool is particularly useful for a wide range of applications, including network analysis, pattern recognition, genome sequence analysis, chemical compound structure analysis, and more.

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install graph-potential-similarity
```

## Usage
Here's a simple example of how to use the Graph Potential Similarity package:

```python
from graph_potential_similarity import compute_similarity

graph1 = ...  # Define your first graph
graph2 = ...  # Define your second graph

similarity = compute_similarity(graph1, graph2)
print(f"The similarity between the two graphs is: {similarity}")
```
